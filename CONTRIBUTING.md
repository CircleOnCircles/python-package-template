# How to contribute

This is a how-to-contribute guide for the template itself.
This guide is not about contributing to the project that is created
using this template.

## Dependencies

We use `poetry` to manage the [dependencies](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry).

To install them you would need to run `install` command:

```bash
poetry install
```

And then install pre-commit hooks

```bash
poetry run pre-commit install
```
